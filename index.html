						<div id="faq1" class="collapse show" data-parent=".faq-list">
							<p>
								A sleep study is a diagnostic test utilized in the evaluation of patients with sleep
								disorders typically characterized by symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and/or
								fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, snoring, nocturnal movement disorders, and suspected sleep
								apnea. Sleep studies are an important addition to the comprehensive sleep evaluation
								because patients are not fully aware of what happens during sleep. During the sleep
								study, we monitor several physiological parameters including brain waves, eye movements
								and chin muscle tone to determine the stage of sleep and airflow, snoring, oxygen
								levels, electrical activity of the heart, arm and leg movements, and abdominal and chest
								movement to diagnose specific sleep disorders.

						<div id="faq2" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
							<p>
								In patients with high likelihood of moderate to severe sleep apnea, home sleep testing
								is comparable to tests performed in the sleep lab. HSTs tend to underestimate the
								severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared to an in-lab sleep test, but it does
								detect the presence of OSA.

						<div id="faq3" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
							<p>
								Depending on your disease, sometimes you may feel short of breath even though your body
								is getting the oxygen it needs. It is important to use good breathing techniques, use
								your medications properly, and discuss with your healthcare provider your symptoms so
								your specific needs can be met.

								Exercise can be used to improve functional endurance and strength, so tasks become
								easier with less shortness of breath.

						<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq4" class="collapsed">What is pulmonary function testing? <i
								class="icofont-simple-up"></i></a>
						<div id="faq4" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
							<p>
								Pulmonary function tests (also called PFTs or lung function tests) help determine how
								well your lungs are functioning. The results of these tests determine how much air your
								lungs can hold, how quickly you can move air into and out of your lungs, and how well
								your lungs are able to use oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.

								The tests help your doctor determine if you have a lung disease, provide a measure of
								how significant your lung disease is, and can show how well the treatment for your lung
								disease is working.

							<p>
								Please arrive 30 minutes before your appointment to fill out the necessary paperwork
								(see our Forms Page). Your visit may take up to 90 minutes. Occasionally, delays do
								happen. As always, we will do everything we can to make sure that your visit runs
								smoothly and on time.

						<div id="faq6" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
							<p>
								Most insurance companies, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, provide coverage for sleep
								studies. But patients should always verify their coverage benefits before a study is
								done by calling the member-benefits contact at their insurance company. The
								representative should be asked about outpatient sleep study coverage and coverage
								benefits under the CPT insurance codes of 95810 or 95811.
